Advantages:<br /> 
&emsp; highly expressive nonlinear models<br /> 
&emsp;have advances in computer vision and speech that other methos &emsp;have not achieved<br /> 
	can capture latent structure withing the hidden layers <br /> 

Disadvantages:<br /> 
&emsp;can get stuch in local optima, could produce bad solutions<br /> 
&emsp;black box<br /> 
&emsp;lots of tuning parameters<br />
