GMM is one of the clustering mathod. We can also use it to measure the probability density function. 
GMM is based on the assumption that all the datas follow mixture gaussian distribution. In other words, we consider the data points are generated multiple gaussian distribution. 
GMM is a "soft margin" algorithm, where each point probabilistically "belongs" to all clusters.
